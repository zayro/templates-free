Hello thanks for visiting Illusive Design and downloading one of our templates. I hope you enjoy it.

For this template to work you have to place all the images in a folder named images, 
and place this folder in the same directory as .html file.

I would Like to help everyone but I don't have the time so please do not contact me for 
help configuring a template. I do offer my services for a fee contact me using the contact
form on my site.

If you would like to learn how to design visit the resources section of my site there you'll find
some sites that I learned from.
