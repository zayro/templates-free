        <br>
        <span class="content">Red Faction offers Multiplayer Capture the Flag 
        for two opposing teams of players. The object of the game is to score 
        points for your team by collecting your opponents' flag and returning 
        it to your base while protecting your own flag. Teams are awarded one 
        point per capture. To capture, you have to touch your opponents' flag 
        to automatically steal it. While carrying the flag, you will see a flashing 
        flag icon in the lower left of the screen besides the team score. You 
        must return the enemy flag to your own flag stand while your flag is there 
        in order to score a point. If your own flag is stolen, to return it to 
        the flag stand you must kill the opponent carrying the flag, which will 
        be visible on his back and will emanate a glow that matches your team 
        color. When killed, the opponent will drop the flag in the field -- you 
        must touch the flag to return it to your base before another opponent 
        comes and touches the flag to pick it back up. Games can be set to terminate 
        after a certain number of captures by a team or can end after a set time. 
        In addition to team score, players are awarded individual points for kills 
        as well as capturing or defending flags. Individual scores do not affect 
        team score.</span></p>
