	that will help you create any newsletter layout in minutes
	by simply copy/paste-ing pieces of source code.

	Open it be clicking on: 00-start.html

	Creating a layout has 4 easy steps:

	1. Select a Base File (the shell that will hold the modules that will contain the actual newsletter content) 
		- save it as a new html file
		- read in documentation how to customize it if needed


	2. Add Modules (precoded tables used to create different colomn structures) inside the base file
		- add the modules in the base file starting from the comment <!-- START MAIN CONTENT. ADD MODULES BELOW -->
		- add module dividers or <br>'s between the modules to create space


	3. Add content in the modules
		- use the placeholder images in /placeholders and the text from /placeholders/lorem-ipsum.txt for fast mock-up


	4. Finish
		-copy your html file along with the /images and /placeholders folders to another location
		- delete from the folders the iamges you are not using
		- add your texts and pictures
		- host all images on a server and change all paths to absolute paths in the layout file
		- inline the css
		- test and send
