		<h3 id="installation"><strong>A) Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<div class="subsection" id="wordpress-installation">
			<h4>WordPress Installation</h4>
			<p>This theme requires a working version of WordPress to already be installed on your server. If you need to install WordPress then please visit: <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank">http://wordpress.org/download/</a>. If you need any help with the installation, please refer to this guide: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress</a>.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="theme-installation">
			<h4>Theme Installation</h4>
			<p>The theme files need to be uploaded before you can activate the theme for use. There are two ways you can do this, <strong>FTP upload</strong> or <strong>WordPress upload</strong>.</p>
			<p>If you are uploading via <strong>FTP upload</strong>, then you need to upload the unzipped folder “pinpoint” to the /wp-content/themes folder of your WordPress installation.</p>
			<p>If you are uploading via <strong>WordPress upload</strong>, then navigate within the WordPress admin area to <span>Appearance > Add New Themes > Upload</span>. Select the zipped file “<strong>pinpoint.zip</strong>” and then hit Install Now.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="subsection" id="activating-theme">
			<h4>Activating Pinpoint</h4>
			<p>Once you have uploaded the theme, you need to activate it by going to <span>Appearance > Themes</span>, and activate “Pinpoint”.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="clear"></div>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="setting-up"><strong>B) Setting up</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<div class="subsection" id="demo-content">
			<h4>Demo Content</h4>
			<p>Both the theme content and theme options have been provided so that you can set up the theme to look exactly like the demo in a few minutes. You can find the main demo XML file, along with the demo content XML files for each of the example sites in the main download folder. This XML file is to use through the WordPress import tool, which can be found in Tools > Import > WordPress. Follow the steps to import the demo content and leave the final page to load with a confirmation that the content has been imported successfully (this may take some time).</p>
			<p>Once you have imported the demo content XML, you will still need to set the home page by going to Settings > Reading, and also select the menu in Appearance > Menus.</p>
			<p>The theme options text file is to copy and paste the contents into the box provided within Pinpoint Options, under the Import/Export sub-menu.</p>
			<p>If you have any issues with the import, i.e. any errors, then please contact your hosting to increase your php memory upload limit before contacting our support for help.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="subsection" id="logo">
			<h4>Logo</h4>
			<p>You can change the theme’s logo by accessing the Pinpoint Options and uploading your logo with the uploader under the “Header Options” section.</p>
			<img src="assets/images/logo-options.png" style="width:70%;margin: 0 15%;"/>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>There are also logo spacing controls if you would like to manually add padding the logo area.</p>			
		</div>

		<div class="subsection" id="menus">
			<h4>Menus</h4>
			<p>By selecting the <span>Appearance > Menus</span> option from the WordPress admin sidebar, you can set the top navigation by creating a menu, and on the left under Theme Locations set the <span>Main Menu</span> dropdown to be your newly created menu and then click save. This will allocate your created menu to the header navigation of the theme.</p>
			<img src="assets/images/menu-options.png" style="width:80%;margin: 0 10%;"/>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>The theme supports two levels of drop-down, so you can manage your menu items and allow for deeper navigation.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="posts">
			<h4>Posts</h4>
			<p>The <span>Posts</span> menu option on the left is where you add blog posts. To add a new blog post, select the <span>Posts > Add New</span> option from the left hand WordPress menu.</p>
			<p>You will then be able to set a title for the blog post, add the body content, and also provide all the meta information such as extra details and media. In the blog meta you can set the image for the thumbnail, and also the media type for the detail page.</p>
			<p>You can use the Swift Page Builder to create the content of the item, which effectively allows you to have limitless possibilities for what you can display, and also how you can display it. If you do use the Page Builder to create the content, you will want to provide a custom excerpt (can be found in the item meta).</p>
			<p>To display your blog posts, you will then need to create a page that includes the "Blog" or "Recent Posts" page builder asset. The blog asset has the following options included, allowing you to customise the output to your liking:</p>
			<img src="assets/images/blog-options.png" style="width:70%;margin: 0 15%;"/>
			<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> DO NOT set the posts page in Settings > Reading, as this will force your page to show the standard layout, and not follow your created page.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="subsection" id="portfolio">
			<h4>Portfolio</h4>
			<p>The <span>Portfolio</span> menu option on the left is where you add Portfolio items. To add a new portfolio item, select the <span>Portfolio > Add New</span> option from the left hand WordPress menu.</p>
			<p>You will then be able to set a title for the portfolio item, add the body content, and also provide all the meta information such as extra details and media. In the portfolio meta you can set the image for the thumbnail, and also the media type for the detail page.</p>
			<p>You can add categories for each portfolio item's which act as the filters in the filtering system, and also a way to create multiple portfolio pages. You can have subcategories for filtering on a category Portfolio page, so none of the functionality is lost. When setting up categories, it is important that you name the slugs correctly. The slug of each category should be the same as the name, but all lowercase. If the category name contains spaces, then these should be represented in the slug with a '-'.</p>
			<p>You can use the Swift Page Builder to create the content of the item, which effectively allows you to have limitless possibilities for what you can display, and also how you can display it. If you do use the Page Builder to create the content, you will want to provide a custom excerpt (can be found in the item meta).</p>
			<p>To display your portfolio items, you will then need to create a page that includes the "Portfolio" page builder asset. The portfolio asset has the following options included, allowing you to customise the output to your liking:</p>
			<img src="assets/images/portfolio-options.png" style="width:70%;margin: 0 15%;"/>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="showcase">
			<h4>Showcase</h4>

			<p>The slide image is taken from the Featured Image for the slide, so make sure you attach a featured image.</p>
			<p>If you would like to add a link to the slide, then enter a link into the "Slide Link" field.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="sliders">
			<h4>Sliders</h4>
			<p>The <span>Sliders</span> menu option on the left is where you add slides to create groups of sliders which you can then use wherever you like within your content. To add a new slider, select the <span>Sliders > Slide Groups</span> option from the left hand WordPress menu. Here you can add a new group, where each group is taken as an individual slider.</p>
			<p>You can then go to <span>Sliders > Add New Slide</span>. To create a slide you will want to follow the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Give the slide a title.</li>
				<li>Select a group for the slide in the right column (Slide Groups). This will add it to that slider group.</li>
				<li>You'll then want to add your media, so click the Add Media button. You can then choose to either upload an image, provide a URL, or select an existing image.</li>
				<li>Once you have the image you want to use, click "Insert to post".</li>
				<li>If you'd like to instead use a Vimeo/YouTube video embed for the slide, simply post the iframe embed code into the "Text" tab of the editor.</li>
				<li>Enter an excerpt in the box below for if you choose to display an excerpt over the top of the slide.</li>
				<li>Publish your slide.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To display a slider in the content of posts or pages, you will find that we have conveniently added a new tab in the "Add Media" popup window tited "Sliders". Inside this tab, you can setup your slider with settings specific to the type of slider selected, as well as override any of the "Advanced Settings" specified on the main "Settings" screen. To add a slider, please use the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click the "Add Media" button above the WYSIWYG editor when editing your page/post/post type.</li>
				<li>Select the "Sliders" tab.</li>
				<li>Choose your desired slideshow type and setup the options pertaining to the selected type (all fields are optional).</li>
				<li>If you'd like to override any of the global slideshow settings, click the "Advanced Settings" button and make any adjustments you'd like (only the modified items will be added to the shortcode).</li>
				<li>Click the "Insert Slider" button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To add a slider in a Page Builder page, just insert a text block to the size you want it to be on the page, then add the slider to the content of that text block.</p>
		</div>

			<h4>Swift Page Builder</h4>
			<img src="assets/images/swift-page-builder2.png" style="width:70%;margin: 0 15%;"/>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>The Swift Page Builder (SPB) allows you to create unique and amazing pages, exactly the way you want them! The SPB is powered by shortcodes, which are embedded when you select the content elements you want, and edit them. You can see the source by going back to the classic editor, although you shouldn't ever need to do this and you should only make changes to this if you know what you're doing.</p>
			<img src="assets/images/swift-page-builder.png" style="width:70%;margin: 0 15%;"/>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>To add a content element to the page, all you need to do is drag the element from the dropdown into the content area, or simply click on it to have it added automatically. You can then edit the column width (on applicable elements) by pressing the left/right arrows in the top left of the content element, and also edit the asset (the pencil), duplicate the element, or delete the element.</p>
			<img src="assets/images/spb-col-width.png" style="width:34%;float:left;margin: 0 4% 0 12%;"/>
			<img src="assets/images/spb-controls.png" style="width:34%; margin: 0 12% 0 4%;"/>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>When you click on the edit button, you will be given the option of specifying a number of parameters based on the content element. Below is a screenshot from the edit screen of the Portfolio content element. As you can see there are a wide number of options for you to choose from.</p>
			<img src="assets/images/spb-edit.png" style="width:70%;margin: 0 15%;"/>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>The SPB includes a Blank Spacer element, which allows you to add spacing in between your content elements, to suit your needs. We decided on making this user controlled, so that there is never a case where you don't have the spacing you need.</p>
			<img src="assets/images/spb-spacer.png" style="width:50%;margin: 0 25%;"/>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>Please watch the video below to get an idea of how to use the Page Builder:</p>

		</div>
		
		
		<div class="subsection" id="#color-customizer">
			<h4>Color Customizer</h4>
			<p>The color customizer can be accessed by pressing the "Color Customizer" button within the WordPress admin bar, or through the Appearance > Themes menu. From the color customizer you can preview the themes color/skin changes as you make them.</p>
			<img src="assets/images/color-options.png" style="width:70%;margin: 0 15%;"/>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="theme-options">
			<h4>Pinpoint Options</h4>
			<p>The theme options can be used to customise the theme to suit your needs, including backgrounds, layouts and much more. You should take the time to go through all of these options to ensure that you are getting the most out of the theme.</p>
			<img src="assets/images/theme-options.png" style="width:70%;margin: 0 15%;"/>
		</div>

		<div class="subsection" id="custom-page-templates">
			<h4>Custom Page Templates</h4>
			<p><span>Default</span> - This page template is the default page template, which can be set up to display in various configurations through the page meta options, and you can either add content via the standard WordPress editor, or through the Swift Page Builder.</p>
			<p><span>Full Width Showcase (Rev Slider)</span> - This page template is exactly the same as the default page template, except it has a fixed full width slider at the top of the page. This template is ideal for use with the full width layout. You will need to enter the alias for the Revolution Slider that you'd like to use in the meta below the content editor.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="#revolution-slider">
			<h4>Revolution Slider</h4>
			<p>The theme includes the premium plugin - Revolution Slider. You can find documentation for this included within the Documentation > Revolution Slider Documentation folder.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="subsection" id="custom-widgets">
			<h4>Custom Widgets</h4>
			<p><span>Flickr</span> - This flickr widget shows off your flickr photos. You can get the required API Key from this link: http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html.</p>

			<p><span>Twitter</span> - The Twitter widget displays a number of your latest tweets. You can specify parameters such as username, number of tweets to display, refresh time, and date display.</p>

			<p><span>Video</span> - The Video widget embeds a video from a url that you enter into the input field within the widget options. You can find out what type of video you can embed <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="shortcode-generator">
			<h4>Shortcode Generator</h4>
			<p>Pinpoint includes the <span>Swift Framework Shortcode Generator</span>, which is a custom built feature for our themes. The generator allows you to embed shortcodes within your content quickly without having to remember the syntax. The generator allows you to select the type from the list, and provide parameters (if needed).</p>
			<p>You can find the shortcode generator within the WordPress WYSIWYG editor. The button looks like this:</p>
			<img src="assets/images/shortcode-gen.png" style="width:20%;margin: 0 40%;"/>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="translation">
			<h4>Translation</h4>
			<p>Pinpoint is 100% translation and multi-lingual ready, and we recommend that you use the very popular WPML plugin.</p>
			<a href="http://wpml.org/?aid=27185&affiliate_key=PbyGf1bMfZHc" title="Turn your WordPress site multilingual"><img width="468" height="60" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/themes/sitepress/banners/images/wpml_banner_v1_468x60_en.jpeg" alt="Multilingual WordPress" /></a>
			<p>To translate the static strings, if you aren't using WPML then I recommend downloading PO Edit, from <a href="http://www.poedit.net/" target="_blank">http://www.poedit.net/</a>. Once you have installed please follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the /pinpoint/languages/ folder and duplicate the en_US.po file, then rename it to your desired language code. For example; for German you need to re-name it as de_DE.po for Spanish es_ES.po for Turkish tr_TR.po etc. You can find all the codes from this link <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language</a></li>
				<li>Then you will need to open the .po file in PO Edit. Once opened, you will see all strings that needs to be translated. Type the translation of a string into the "Translation" column. Do not delete or edit "Original string" part.</li>
				<li>When you finish translating, save the file. This will create an .mo file in the same directory.</li>
				<li>Upload the new files into the languages folder of the theme /wp-content/themes/pinpoint/languages/ and then follow this guide: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language#Single-Site_Installations" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language#Single-Site_Installations</a></li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subsection" id="woocommerce">
			<h4>WooCommerce</h4>
			<p>We have provided compatibility pre-built into Pinpoint for WooCommerce. There is a special sidebar for the WooCommerce pages in Appearance > Widgets, that appears only on WooCommerce pages.</p>
			<p>You will need to edit and save each of the individual WooCommerce pages to get the page headings to work.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="subsection" id="custom-login-logo">
			<h4>Custom Login Logo</h4>
			<p>You can change the login logo by replacing the image in the theme’s <span>/images/</span> folder. The image is named “<span>custom-login-logo.png</span>”. You can replace it by uploading the image via your chosen method (e.g. FTP). You can also replace this image through the Pinpoint Options menu under General Options.</p>
