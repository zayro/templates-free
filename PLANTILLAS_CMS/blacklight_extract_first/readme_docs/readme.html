<div class="block23">

<div class="block3 lastblock">
<h3>1.Number of positions</h3>The "BlackLight" Template provides a total of 42 modulepositions, separated into different sections. Click on the image to the left to open a modulepositions overview map. <br /> All modulepositions are collapsible, they are removed completely if they are not in use.
</div>
<hr />
<div class="block23"><h3>2.The header slider module(s)</h3>
The "BlackLight" Template comes with a build in JavaScript slider area. The slider area includes up to 12 slides. Every slide is a stand alone moduleposition called header1, header2, header3...header12. If none of these 12 modulepositions are in use, the slider area disappears completely. If you setup just one moduleposition it will load just this one static module without the sliding navigation. If you use more than one of these modulepositions (for example "header3" and "header5") the slider area will load the first module on show the navigation to "slide" to the second one.
You can use the 12 modulepositions to setup what ever you want. For example: A image, a text, HTML code, a video or one of the thousands of free and commercial Joomla modules out there.
<h4>Slider Setup from the templates manager</h4>As mentioned before the slider area will be activated automatically as soon as you publish a module on position "header1 - header12". But you can also setup some and change some basic values from the templates config screen. To access the config screen click on "extensions->template manager". Select the "MP BlackLight" template from the list and hit the "edit" button in the upper right corner. The templates config screen will appear.
Inside the right column you can setup the hight, the width and the duration between two slides in milliseconds.

<h3>3.Setup individual HTML modules</h3><img src="images/custommodules.png" alt="setup custom modules" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="220px"/>Joomla allow you to add your own modules with your own text/HTML content very easily. We use such custom modules on the templates demo site to outline the different module positions.
If you want to add your own log into your admin backend and click on "extensions->module manager". Hit the "new" icon in the upper right corner and select as module type "custom HTML".<br /> The setup screen of your new module appears. Add a name, select the module position where you want to display your content (take a look at the "module map" above) and add your content into the editor text box at the bottom of the setup screen. You can add texts, images, links and any other HTML elements. Save your module and publish it.

<h3>4.Setup the DropDown menu</h3>
<img src="images/menusetup.jpg" alt="menusetup" align="right" hspace="30" width="180"/>The "BlackLight" template comes with an moduleposition called "mainmenu". To display your main menu module on this position log into your backend and click on "extensions->module manager". Select your main menu module from the list and hit the "edit" button in the upper right corner. The main menu module setup screens appears. Select as moduleposition "mainmenu" and save the changes. To activat the "Suckerfish" drop down function for sub menu items click on "Module Parameters" in the right column and activate the "Always show sub-menu Items" function. Than click on "advanced Parameters" and enter the value "nav" (without the "") into the "Menu Tag ID" input field. Save the changes.
