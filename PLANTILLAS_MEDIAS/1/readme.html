	<h3><strong>About The Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	<p>This theme is designed to be easy to use for either static HTML pages, or to convert for a content management system (CMS). The design is broken down to allow each section to be separated into a self-contained content block. These blocks are marked with comment tags to make finding them easier:
<pre>
&lt;!-- Name of Section or Area --&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;TheIdOfTheContainer&quot; &gt;
	Your HTML Content.
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
	
	<h4>Layouts - <a href="www/sample-layout.html">sample-layout.html</a></h4>
	<p>There are examples of the different layouts and content configurations in the sample pages. Detailed information  can be found on the &quot;Layout&quot; page (<a href="www/sample-layout.html">sample-layout.html</a>) included in the sample files. </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Home Page</strong> - You must include the class &quot;<strong>home</strong>&quot; in the <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> of your home page:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;body class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;</code></p>
		<p><strong>Alternate Layout</strong> - You must include the class &quot;<strong>alternate</strong>&quot; in the <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> of your pages to use the alternate layout style:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;body class=&quot;alternate&quot;&gt;</code></p>
		<p>Or in the case of the home page:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;body class=&quot;home alternate&quot;&gt;</code></p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Text - <a href="www/sample-text.html">sample-text.html</a></h4>
	<p>Text formatting details are also available in the sample files. For this information view the &quot;Text Styles&quot; page (<a href="www/sample-text.html">sample-text.html</a>) included in the sample files. This contains example code and sample outputs of all the common HTML tags used for content editing.</p>
	<h4>Cufon - font replacement</h4>
	<p>This theme takes advantage of <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/">cufon font replacement</a> for headings and other title elements. The font used, &quot;Perspective Sans&quot;, is a free font available online. If you have missing characters in your titles, such as accent marks or symbols, you will need to recreate the cufon file. To do this, download the font file below, and using the <a href="http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/">cufon</a> website, create a new font replacement JavaScript file. Include the  glyphs you require for your text and replace the existing file in the theme &quot;<strong>www/js</strong>&quot; folder. This should not be necessary in most cases. Exceptions may include the need for Russian characters, etc.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.dafont.com/perspective-sans.font">Download "Perspective Sans"</a></p>
	<h4>Logo Fonts</h4>
	<p>The logos in the included skins use &quot;Harabara&quot; as the font. This is a free font available online.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.dafont.com/harabara.font?nb_ppp=50&af=on&l[]=10&l[]=1&text=boost">Download "Harabara"</a></p>
	<h4>Skins and Design</h4>
	<p>There are several pre-made skins included with the theme. For detailed information on creating custom skins or using a single skin please refer to the &quot;<a href="#skin"><strong>Skinning the Theme</strong></a>&quot; section of this document.</p>
	<h4>Login Popup</h4>
	<p>The  popup login form  uses AJAX calls to retrieve the form content. Because of the nature of HTTP response codes, this  will only work when the files are uploaded to a live web server. Local copies of the theme will see a loading graphic or nothing at all when clicking the login link. If you experience this issue try uploading your files to your website and testing  from there.  If you would like more information about this you can visit the Fancybox website (fancybox.net) to access their support forum.</p>	
	<p><span class="note">Note:</span> Although every effort has been made to ensure the theme is bug free and easy to use, if you encounter a problem please notify me immediately through my <strong><a href="http://themeforest.net/user/Parallelus" target="_blank">ThemeForest account page</a></strong> so I can ensure it gets fixed as quickly as possible.</p>
	<hr>
	<a name="structure"></a>
	<h3>Layout and Design Structure - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	<p>This theme is a fixed-width design with pre-configured styles for creating layouts with one, two or three columns. </p>
	<p>The default content area is commented to make it easier to find. Look for the HTML comment with the text &quot;Page Content&quot;. These comments will help you identify the function of the different areas of the code.</p>
		<blockquote><code>&lt;!-- Page Content --&gt;</code></blockquote>
	<p>If you would like to edit the color, font, or style of any elements in one of these columns, you would do the following:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
.contentArea a {
	color: [color];
} 
</pre></blockquote>

	<p>If you find that your new style is not overriding, it is most likely because of a specificity problem. Scroll down in your CSS file and make sure that there isn't a similar style that has more weight.</p>

		<p>I.E.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
body .contentArea a {
	color: [color];
}
</pre></blockquote>

	<p>To ensure that your new styles are applied, make sure that they carry enough "weight" and that there isn't a style lower in the CSS file that is being applied after yours.</p>
		<p>The HTML code is  indented to make it easier to edit. There are also comment markers as a guides to find the beginning and end of major sections such as the top, header, slide show, page content and footer. Each of these sections is labeled with the appropriate tags and has a corresponding ID tag of the main container for that section.</p>
		<p>You should  use the included sample files as templates for your own layouts. Be sure to backup a file before editing it, or create a copy and work from it.</p>

	<hr>
	<a name="css" />		
		<h3>CSS Files and Structure - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>There are several CSS files included with this theme, but only a few will be necessary for customization. The CSS files are all located in the &quot;<strong>/www/css</strong>&quot; folder. Within that folder there are two sub-folders, &quot;<strong>source</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>skins</strong>&quot;. </p>
		<p>The first folder, &quot;<strong>source</strong>&quot;, contains the original CSS files with formatted code and comments. Only a few files are in this folder. Some of these are the original CSS files for add on scripts used in the design. If you  find a CSS file that is uncommented and you need the original, check this folder.</p>
		<p>The second folder, &quot;<strong>skins</strong>&quot;, houses the skin specific style sheet for each custom skin. If you create your own custom skin, it is recommended you save the style sheet in this folder.</p>
		<h4>Primary CSS Files</h4>
	<blockquote>
			<p><strong>default.css</strong> (required)</p>
			<p>This file provides the foundation for the site design and all skins. It controls the layout and design structure of the theme. Making modifications to this file will usually effect all skins unless it is a color or image related change. The skin files act as an extension of &quot;<strong>default.css</strong>&quot; to apply custom colors and graphics. Before you edit this file you should consider making a custom skin style sheet or editing the one you are already using for your design.</p>
			<p><strong>/skins/skin-#.css</strong></p>
			<p>These are the skin specific style sheets. For the purposes of the online demo, these files are named numerically in a format such as, &quot;<strong>skin-#.css</strong>&quot;. If you plan to continue using the dynamic style switching functions that are included in the demo, you must name your skin files this way. If you are going to use a single skin you can name the file however you like, and even save it in a different folder if you choose. </p>
	</blockquote>




	<hr>
	<a name="skin" />	
	<h3>Skinning the Theme - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
	<p>Each  color style, &quot;skin&quot;, is controlled by a custom CSS  file. These are located in &quot;<strong>/www/css/skins</strong>&quot;. If you want to keep the ability to use different colors and change them on the fly you will want to maintain this structure. The images for each skin are saved in a folder under <strong>&quot;/www/images/skins/skin-123/</strong>&quot; where &quot;<strong>skin-123</strong>&quot; is the name of your CSS file. To create a custom skin, duplicate an existing skin CSS files and edit it as desired. You can easily output the custom graphics for you skin using one of the &quot;<strong>Theme Graphics - for skinning.PSD</strong>&quot; files located in the &quot;<strong>Design\Files for skinning</strong>&quot; folded included with the theme.</p>
		<p>After creating the skin CSS file and a matching images folder, save your images to this folder. Use the &quot;<strong>Save for web...</strong>&quot; feature of Photoshop and select &quot;<strong>All user slices</strong>&quot; to get the desired graphics. You can create a custom skin in a few minutes by modifying the background colors of the main  layers in this file. If you want to get more detailed and tweak the output you can edit the individual highlights and shadow features of the layers above the backgrounds. Play with the different layers to see what effect they have. The file was designed to allow easy and fast skinning.</p>
		<p>After you have the new skin CSS file and images folder created, update the   reference in your HTML file's &lt;HEAD&gt; tag of each HTML page to use this new skin (see below for details). </p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><strong>Dynamic Skin Changer</strong></p>
			<p>If you plan to use the included skin switcher you don't need to change the CSS link in the &lt;HEAD&gt; section of your HTML files. You can add a thumbnail graphic to the slider and it will show your new skin in the animation. If you have increased the total number of skins and intend to keep the skin slider, open &quot;<strong>demo.js</strong>&quot; and edit the total number of skins line: <code>var skinCnt = 5;</code></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><span class="note">IMPORTANT: </span>If you are going to create a custom skin or do any advanced code   editing, you will likely need to edit the JavaScript loading file, "<strong>js/onLoad.js</strong>"   This file controls  loading and executing of many dynamic JavaScript   functions used in the theme. </p>
		<h4>To create a single skin for your site</h4>
	<p>The best way to go about creating your own skin, is by starting from one of the pre-made styles that come with the theme. An easy way to do this would be as follows:</p>
<ol>
			<li>First, create a copy of an existing style sheet from &quot;<strong>/www/css/skins/skin-#.css</strong>&quot;, and increment the # to the next unused value. </li>
			<li>Create a duplicate of the same skin's images folder located in &quot;<strong>/www/images/skins/skin-#</strong>&quot;</li>
			<li>Give your new images folder the same name as the CSS file by incrementing the number to match.</li>
		<li>Open the &quot;<strong>Theme Graphics - for skinning.psd</strong>&quot; file in the &quot;<strong>Design/Files for skinning</strong>&quot; folder and modify the colors to create your desired graphics.</li>
			<li>Output the graphics using &quot;<strong>Save for web...</strong>&quot; to the new skin's images folder. Choose &quot;<strong>All user created slices</strong>&quot; as the option for output method when asked.</li>
			<li>Open the new CSS file for your skin. Do a find and replace for the path to your images folder, this would be something like, Find: &quot;<strong>skin-5</strong>&quot;, Replace with: &quot;<strong>skin-6</strong>&quot;, to update all occurrences of the image folder path in the file. Save when finished.</li>
		<li>Update the link in your HTML files pointing to your new CSS skin file:<br>
<pre>
&lt;!-- Skin Style Sheet --&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/skins/skin-1.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; id=&quot;SkinCSS&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<strong>(change the file name from "skin-1.css" to the name of your new skin file) </strong></li>
			<li>Save your HTML files and load the page to preview the new skin.</li>
			<li>Open your skin CSS file and begin editing the individual style properties to match the graphics you have created for your new skin.</li>
			<li>Save, upload and enjoy!</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Font Shadows and Highlights</h4>
	<p>After you have created your skin, or configured the theme to work with the skin of your choice, you may notice that font highlights and shadows no longer match your colors. These are a feature of the cufon font replacement. To edit these, open &quot;<strong>js/onLoad.js</strong>&quot; and scroll to the very end of the file. These styles can be configured from here. If you want to use an existing skin and need the styles from the demo site, open &quot;<strong>js/demo.js</strong>&quot; and scroll to the very end of the file. You will find a customized version of these styles here. One exists for each included skin. Paste the desired styles in to &quot;<strong>onLoad.js</strong>&quot;, replacing the existing calls to cufon and your are ready to go.</p>
	<h4>More about skinning this design</h4>
	<p>The sample pages included with this theme provide documentation relevant to each section. You can find more information about the CSS styles and skinning of the design by viewing the samples.</p>

	<hr>
	<a name="contact" />
	<h3><strong>Contact Form</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

<h4>Contact form setup</h4>
	<p>The theme includes a working contact form. This form uses PHP and requires a server running PHP for it to work. </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Adding Your Email Address</strong></p>
		<p>To add your own email address to the form, open the file &quot;<strong>contact-send.ph</strong>p&quot; and at the very top of the file replace &quot;<strong>yourname@yourwebsite.com</strong>&quot; with your own email address. Be sure not to delete the quotes, semi-colon or other code when making this change.</p>
		<p><code>$YourEmailAddress = &quot;<strong>yourname@yourwebsite.com</strong>&quot;;</code></p>
		<p><strong>Problems Sending Emails</strong></p>
		<p>If you experience trouble sending emails you should verify the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure the address entered in &quot;<strong>contact-send.php</strong>&quot; is correct.</li>
			<li>Verify that PHP is installed on the server your site is running from.</li>
			<li>If necessary contact your hosting provider to ensure they do not need to activate something.</li>
		</ol>
	</blockquote>
<h4>Pages with Contact Forms</h4>
		<p>You must include the following code in the &lt;HEAD&gt; tag of any page with the contact form.</p>
	<blockquote><pre>&lt;!-- form validation scripts (for contact page) --&gt;<br>&lt;script src=&quot;js/jquery.validate.min.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>	<br>&lt;!-- Contact form triggers and AJAX submit --&gt;<br>&lt;script src=&quot;js/contactForm.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>For and example of this review the included contact form sample page.</p>
				<hr>
	<a name="config"></a>
	<h3>Special Features - <a href="#toc">top</a><br></h3>
	<h4>Alternate Layouts</h4>
		<p>The theme includes 2 layout styles. The default style will be what displays normally. To use the alternate layout style which includes a header background color, add the class &quot;<strong>alternate</strong>&quot; to the <strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag of your pages.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><code>&lt;body class=&quot;alternate&quot;&gt;</code></p>
		</blockquote>
	<h4>Button Style Disabling</h4>
		<p>The custom button styles will automatically apply to any &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input type=&quot;[submit or button]&quot;&gt; on your page. In some situations you may need a button not to have these styles to preserve special functionality. You can add the class &quot;noStyle&quot; to any button and it will be ignored by the button styling function.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><code>&lt;button class=&quot;noStyle&quot;&gt;Do Not Style This Button&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
		</blockquote>		<h4>Specialty Links</h4>
		<p>You can add several special types of links to tap into built in functionality of the theme.</p>
	<blockquote>
	<h5><strong>Image icons for menu links</strong></h5>
		<p>To add an icon to a menu item, you must do two things. First you need to have the image defined in your style sheet. For an example of this open the default style sheet and search for &quot;.mmFeeds&quot;. The code below shows the basic formatting of these styles.</p>
		<pre>/* icons for menu items */

.mmLogin	{ background: url(...bullet-lock.png)...
.mmFeeds	{ background: url(...bullet-feed.png)...
.mmRSS		{ background: url(...icons/feed.png)...
.mmFacebook	{ background: url(...icons/facebook.png)...
.mmTwitter	{ background: url(.../icons/twitter2.png)...</pre>
		<p>Create your own entry by copying an existing one and giving it a custom class name. After you have this entry, add the new image you entered the path for to the location you specified. Next add a &lt;span&gt; tag around your menu item title resembling the following:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;span class=&quot;mmFeeds&quot;&gt;Feeds&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>

		<p>Where the &quot;Feeds&quot; text	is your menu item text and &quot;mmFeeds&quot; class is the class of your custom menu icon class created in the style sheet.</p>
		<h5><strong>Login pages, top slide and pop-ups</strong></h5>
		<p>You can  add links that activate the custom login pop-up or the slide open top area. Include the path to the page you want to open and append one of the following to choose the function.</p>
		<p><strong>Pop-up Login (#login):</strong> To create a link that opens the login pop-up,  at the end of your login file URL add &quot;<strong>#login</strong>&quot;. Alternately, you can also add the class &quot;login&quot; to any link to achieve the same functionality. See the sample files main menu section for an example of this method.</p>
		<p><strong>Slide Open Top (#topReveal):</strong> To create a link that opens the slide top, enter &quot;<strong>#topReveal</strong>&quot; in your link's URL, or add the class &quot;topReveal&quot; to any link. Review the main menu included in the sample files for an example of this method.</p>
		<p><strong>Any content as pop-up (class=&quot;iframe&quot;):</strong> You can optionally enter any URL and add the class &quot;iframe&quot;  and it will open in a pop-up. This can be an internal or external path, for example:</p>
		<blockquote><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot; class=&quot;iframe&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</code></blockquote>
		<p> This can be useful for linking to maps or other informational content.</p>
