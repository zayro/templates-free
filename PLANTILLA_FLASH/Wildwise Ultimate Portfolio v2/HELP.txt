MP3's
***************************
That's really simple to use and doesn't even need an XML file. Just need to prepare your MP3 files and ID3 tags.

1. HOW TO prepare your MP3 files
- Here is the way to name you MP3 files correctly :
The 5 first characters of the name of the file are dedicated to order your MP3s in the playlist.
Then arrives the name of your song.
Finally, it ends with the extension ".mp3"
For example: 00001mySong.mp3
the 5 digits allows you to add till 99 999 songs. The MP3player will order the files in the playlist according to this number.
The extension ".mp3" allows the PHP file to browse the directory, to pick all the ".mp3" files, then to send all file names to flash.

- Here is the way to prepare your mp3's ID3 tags :
They will appear in the scrolling text once a MP3 is loaded.
Go to your favorite MP3player on your computer (mine is winamp). Open the files you'd like to put in your flash MP3player.
Now you can edit ID3 tags by right-clicking your file name and click "view file info" (always in winamp huh ? I don't know how works the other players, but it should be the same).
Fill the ID3 v1 and v2 fields, save, and that's it !
The flash MP3player will load and display the title, the artist and the year of the song !
If ID3 tags are not filled, the textfield will display the name of the mp3 without digits and extension ("mySong" in my example).

2. HOW TO organize your MP3 files
- Put your MP3s in the mp3 directory.

3. WHAT ARE this MP3player features ?
- REPEAT ALL
- NO SHUFFLE
- TYPING TEXT INFORMATIONS ABOUT SONG AND TIME
- SLIDING VOLUME
- PRELOAD STATUS BAR
- PLAY, STOP, NEXT, PREVIOUS
- ELAPSED TIME

4. WHERE ARE these wonderfull watermarked MP3s from ?
- you would like to get these great tracks for your own without the FD watermark, for a very cheap price huh ?
Go to the Den of my friend Adrien (ADG3 Studios), he has got some bombing sounds ! http://www.flashden.net/user/ADG3studios?ref=wildwise
