I wanted to make it like presentation of the template itself. I decided to use my handwriting tool to create cool animation for the home page, that draws the logo of the template. Also I chose the orange color, which I think is a good accent color. Next I started to write my text content. The images I wanted to put in my galleries I also created from screenshots of the template.<br><br>After preparing all the example content of my template and testing it I packed everything and now I hope for the best.]]></content>
