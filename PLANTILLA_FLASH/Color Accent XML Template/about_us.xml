I tried really hard to accomplish the quality of the products that some of the <font color="$accent_color"><u><a href="http://www.flashden.net/author/top_sellers/" target="_blank">best authors</a></u></font> offer you. I hope my item will give you the flexibility you want and that it will inspire you to customize it into very beautiful sites.<img src="materials/logo_test.swf" width="200" height="70" margin="10 5 5 15" align="right"> I was inspired by the effect I created for my <font color="$accent_color"><u><a href="http://www.flashden.net/item/flipping-tiles-slideshow/14534/" target="_blank">flipping tiles slideshow</a></u></font> and decided to expand the idea. I present you a horizontal menu with submenus, a tiled resizable background, a text tool which preloads the images and shows them with a tween, a very cool rectangular preloader, a slideshow, a simple video player, a simple audio player and a gallery. I forgot to mention the news tool.<br><br>I put all customizable variables in XML files.
