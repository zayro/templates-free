The task was not difficult but made my item far more flexible. <font color="$accent_color"><u><a href="http://www.flashden.net/item/xml-flipping-tiles-slideshow-v2/14728" target="_blank">XML FLIPPING TILES SLIDESHOW V2</a></u></font> was presented to the clients. I wanted to put more control into it. So I added next and previous buttons and an url button associated to every slide. At this time I decided that I want to go further and do the template where every page of it shows with this effect.]]></content>
