I wanted to have multilevel menu, to have fullscreen support, to have tiled background, to have audio and video, to present a gallery with slideshow and image comments, to create a tool which shows text and images, to make these images preload and show in a cool way, to design a clean look of all items and to put the color accent upon everything.<br><br>To start coding is the hardest part for me.
