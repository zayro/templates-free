<description><![CDATA[We were really searching for a stud, and also just curious to see our 'neighbour' in Italy, who had dogs with the same ancestry, FlameWood's Rainbow Dragon, as our Nala. His dogs made an impression, and apparently so did we with him, for all of a sudden there was this offer, a beautiful male, potential show quality. And he sure was beautiful, so we got in the car, drove to Italy, ad had a look. He was really great (the whole litter actually), and awfully sweet. For the future he also seems to have good complientary qualities to Nala. Great angulation, nice long neck, dark eyes. And so Blade entered our lives to complete our family, a very different type from Nala, but he's lovely.]]></description>
