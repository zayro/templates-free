<description><![CDATA[A beautiful end has come to a year long search for a stud. From our base in Northeast-Italy we have personally visited the last two candidates. Another 1560 kilometres, wonderful people and two extraordinary, though very different, dogs. Almost too beautiful to chose from. Still we did make our choice, and with great pride we announce the combination for which we have planned a litter this autumn:
Ch. Parastone's Creamy Cappuccino (Nala) - rWW & multiCh WB MF Golden Dog in the World (Panda)
