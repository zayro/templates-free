<p>In this one, I'm going to show you how to add new mp3's inside our player.</p>


<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Alright guys, let's open our root directory and let's see what's all about! In order to add new mp3's, we will concentrate on two things: one is the <b>mp3s</b> directory and the other is the <b>data.xml</b> file. In the mp3s directory we will place all our mp3 files and by editing the data.xml file we will tell flash what to open, from where and what it's title,artist,album name are. Let's have a look at the picture:</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Now that we know where and what, let's place our new mp3 file inside the <b>mp3s</b> directory. I named it <b>6.mp3</b> but you can name it however you want as long as you make the good connection with the XML.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="4.jpg" border="0" /></div>


<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>We placed our new mp3 where it belongs, now let's open the <b>data.xml</b> file and let's call that new song! Copy and paste the last node and change it's path as shown in the picture. Be sure you also modify it's title, artist, album etc.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="2.jpg" border="0" /></div><br>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="3.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<br>
<b>Save your changes to the XML</b>


<p>That's it! Now we can test the index.swf and we will see that we just added our sixth mp3 file. Check the bottom of the list ;)</p>
