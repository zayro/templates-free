<p>In this one, I'm going to show you how to change the logo and the content of the footer</p>


<h3>Logo</h3>
<p>Save your logo as as png with transparent background. Name it <b>logo.png and overwrite the current <b>logo.png</b> from the root directory. That's all!</b></p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="1.jpg" border="0" /></div><br>

<h3>Footer</h3>
<p>Open the <b>footer.xml</b> file from the root directory and write your own footer there. Don't forget to save changes. ;)</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="2.jpg" border="0" /></div><br>
