
<h1>Main ideas / How to</h1>
<p>Ok guys! This are the main ideas in order to help you customize this file.</p>


<h3>Backgrounds</h3>
<p>Backgrounds can be changed from within the site. They're XML driven and at the moment they're 4. The XML file related to the backgrounds is <b>backgrounds.xml</b> The pictures with the backgrounds can be found inside the <b>backgrounds</b> directory from within the root directory.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="1.jpg" border="0" /></div>


<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Want to change the background music? It's easy! The background music is externally loaded and can be found inside the root directory under the name of <b>music.mp3</b> Prepare your new song, name it music.mp3 and overwrite mine with yours. Flash will do the rest ;) It loops 100 times.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="2.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<h3>McTween not installed</h3>
<p>Go to the <b>mcTween</b> directory and double click the installer. Folow the steps and there you go!</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="3.jpg" border="0" /></div>

<h3>Why does this appear everytime I test an external swf?</h3>
<p>Because of the paths. There are 2 paths that you need to modify in order for this to work standalone. The path to the XML file(line 30 in portfolio case) and the paths to the pictures inside the XML file.</p>
<div class="tutorial_image"><img src="4.jpg" border="0" /></div>


<h3>So, what's the deal?</h3>
<p>The main idea is that this template loads external swf files. To help you out, I created some modules for you guys. But you can add anything you want. The external swf files dimensions has to be 700x400 (that's ideal). Try not to exceed that 400 height.</p>
Also, everytime you add new swf's inside the swf directory, or into the root directory, try not to forget to make changes also inside the items.xml - that will tell flash what to open when you press the menu buttons.
Again, the main procedure in adding portfolio items or texts or anything else, is duplicating. Duplicating means small changes in every file:
<p>
- you'll tell xml what images to open and from where
</p>
<p>
- then you'll tell to the fla file what xml to open
</p>
<p>
- then you'll tell to the menu what swf to open when pressed
</p>
Once you get these steps, everything will be clear and simple.
As everything is <b>XML driven</b>, you will have to modify xml files in order to add your own content. Every xml is named as the swf file so it should be easy to find and edit them.
