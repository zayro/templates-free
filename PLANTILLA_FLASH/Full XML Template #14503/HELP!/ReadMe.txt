
Thank you for downloading my template! :)


I know that everytime you buy something, you expect to get some satisfaction from what you get and in the first place, you expect great suport from the author. That's what I'm trying to do with this file!



Included:

- XML driven, 3 level, sliding menu (infinite vertical items)
- XML driven News Module (with HTML support)
- XML driven sliding portfolio Module (with FLV player)
- XML driven horizontal sliding portfolio presentation Module
- XML driven HTML formatted text with scrollbar
- Advanced contact form (PHP driven) with send notice
- XML driven background changer
- XML driven mp3 player
- FullScreen feature

- This template gives you the ability to load any external swf file inside in just seconds. So if you bought something from FD or whatever and you wanna use it, the only thing that you need to do is add your swf path inside the menu's xml. My template takes care of the rest(preloading, arrange-ing, etc).
