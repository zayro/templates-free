    <h4>Email php form <br />
        <br />
      How to Customize the php file     </h4>
    <p>1. Open the file called &quot;sendmail.php&quot; in Dreamweaver and update your
      email address. You can have more than one email, just seperate with commas. <br />
      2. When you upload your website make sure the php file is in your root
      directory, your webserver must<br />
      support php so check that they do.<br />
      3. You must also update your domain address
      path to the php file inside fullbrowser.fla. To do this click on the send
      button movie clip. Line 15 in the actionscript you'll see :<br />
      loadVariables(&quot;<span class="style1">http://www.yourdomain.com</span>/sendmail.php&quot;,
this, &quot;POST&quot;); <br />
Change the code highlighted in blue to your domain.
    <h4>To make changes on the look of the contact form such as highlight color
      etc do the following:</h4>
      <p>4. Inside &quot;fullbrowser.fla&quot; go to the &quot;contact&quot; frame
        label, then the Content layer. Click until your inside the contact form
        movie clip. <br />
        5. Inside here you will find an actions layer called &quot;Text Styles&quot; change
        the settings to skin the form.<br />
        6. 
        To change font formatting just click on the text fields and edit there
        properties. <br />
        <br />
        Example of settings:<br />
        - normal_border = 0xFFFFFF;<br />
        - select_border = 0xFFFFFF;<br />
        - normal_background = 0xFFFFFF;<br />
        - select_background = 0x666666;<br />
        - select_color = 0xFFFFFF;<br />
      - normal_color = 0x666666;</p>
      <p>7. Now just publish your flash file and upload everything to your webserver.
        You can only test the form from a webserver, it won't work on your local
    computer. </p></td>
