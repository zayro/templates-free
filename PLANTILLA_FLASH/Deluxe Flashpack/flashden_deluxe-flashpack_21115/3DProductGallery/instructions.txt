Instructions:

THANK YOU FOR PURCHASE MY 3D PRODUCT GALLERY

To customize your template you don't need to have much knowledge of action script programming.
Because all is edited in the xml file. But if you need change fla file, the most important symbols in the library
are photo_mc, image_mc, bigImage_mc

Follow this steps:

1 - In the fla file go to actions panel in the root time line (F9) and edit lines 8 , 28 and 29 with your data.

2 - In the xml folder you will see the gallery.xml file, you need to edit this with your photos and text:

    Each node is one photo:

    photoUrl: thumb path, in this case images/1.jpg . Dimensions must be 250x180 pixels

    bigUrl : big photo path. Dimensions must be 550x360 pixels

    title: photo title, this is the same in the rollover caption

    link: url when you click in the "more info" button. If you don't need this link just leave the field empty like: link=""

    price: price for the product/photo

    In my description change with yours.


3 - Copy and paste this parameters for each photo.

4 - If you want more galleries: goto line 132 in the root actions:

gallerySelected = "gallery";// THIS IS THE NAME OF XML FILE TO BE LOADED, SO IF YOU NEED MORE GALLERIES
JUST ADD MORE BUTTONS AND ON RELEASE ADD ACTIONS: _root.gallerySelected = " yourgallery"; AND _root.images.gotoAndPlay("in");
ADD YOURGALLERY.XML IN THE XML FOLDER AND THATS IT. ENJOY ;)
