HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS FILE?

1 - In the "xml" folder you need edit this xml files:

    menu.xml - is the text for menu buttons, first attribute is the left/up text, and 
    second attribute is the right/down text for each button.

    text.xml - every text to the news, services, about and contact sections must be edit here  

    gallery1.xml...gallery5.xml - you need edit this with path url and description for each photo.
    For example: if you want load swf change the attribute (PhotoUrl="gallery1/1.jpg") to 
    (PhotoUrl="gallery1/1.swf")  
    In this case photos must be located in "gallery1" folder and must be 718x385 pixels dimension 



2 - In the "images" folder you will see some photos that you need edit:

    logo.jpg - is the logo in the top of the site, must be 140x42 pixels
 
    back.jpg - is the background photo and must be 1200x385 pixels 
      
    backBlur.jpg - is the background photo when masked effect appear
    and must be 1200x385 pixels. You can change the masked effect here, just edit this photo
    with colors, noise, ligth brigthness or other to make different effects

    about.jpg, news.jpg and services.jpg are the photos to be loaded to the
    respective sections and must be 380x284 pixels

    IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE THIS NAMES OF THE FILES



3 - put your favourite music at "musica" folder and name the file like "m1.mp3"


4 - If you need edit fla file, most important symbols are the first ones in the library:
    1 -  PHOTOS(foto)
    2 - PAGES
    3 - GALLERY
    4 - GALLERY BUTTONS
    Must important actionscript functions are commented.

5 - If you need to change the names in the subcategories menu (gallery 1, gallery 2, ... , gallery 5), double click 
    in the symbol " 4 - GALLERY" in the library and go to frame 2 actions, you will see:
    but1.text = "Gallery 1";
    but2.text = "Gallery 2";
    but3.text = "Gallery 3";
    but4.text = "Gallery 4";
    but5.text = "Gallery 5";
    Change to yours.

6 - Put your big images in the folder named "bigphotos", in the respective galleries with the same name of point 1.

7 - Double click in the symbol "5 - CONTACT FORM"  in the library and edit actions for send button:

    line 15:
    recipient = "info@yourcompany.com";
	subject = "Message from my site.";
	loadVariables("http://www.yourcompany.com/form.php3", "", "POST");

    edit with your mail and domain and put the file "form.php3 in this directory.

AND THATS ALL, I HOPE YOU ENJOY ;)
