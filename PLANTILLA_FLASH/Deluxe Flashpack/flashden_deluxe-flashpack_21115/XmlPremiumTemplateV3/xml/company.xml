At FlashDen you can buy and sell royalty-free stock files for use in Adobe Flash projects.  Files sell for between 1 and 40 dollars depending on the complexity, quality and use of the file. Anyone is free to sign up for an account and begin trading or purchasing files.
The site is home to a bustling community of Flash designers, developers and devotees. At FlashDen we like to say that it is this community who really owns the site and we do our best to make sure they get the most out of it through programs to generate income, interactivity, news, competitions and whatever else we can dream up.	
Additionally FlashDen is eager to grow and support not only FlashDen users but Flash users everywhere. We do this by supporting community projects, competitions and initiatives. If you have something you think would benefit the Flash community, get in touch!
