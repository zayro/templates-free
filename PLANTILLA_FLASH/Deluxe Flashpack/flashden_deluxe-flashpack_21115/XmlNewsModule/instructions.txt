HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS FILE?

1 - In the "xml" folder you need edit gallery.xml file:

    Example for news nr. 1:
    <Node PhotoUrl="gallery/1.jpg" DateText="07/13/2008" TitleText="XML Title 1" DestUrl="http://flashden.net/user/JorgePires">Description for photo 1 goes here. You can edit by XML the follow parameters: NEWS TITLE, NEWS DATE, DESCRIPTION, LINK URL AND PHOTO URL PATH. Thank you for purchase this file. </Node>
    
    PhotoUrl="gallery/1.jpg : Is the path of your photo nr 1, in this case it is in the folder "gallery" ,named 1.jpg
    Note: you must put your photos in the folder that you define here. Photo Dimensions: 340x300 

    DateText="07/13/2008" : Date for news
 
    TitleText="XML Title 1" : Title in up/right corner or when news is closed

    DestUrl="http://flashden.net/user/JorgePires" : link when you click in the photo nr 1.

    "Description for photo 1 goes here. You can edit by..." : That's it :)


2 - To edit time for the autoplay slider open "preview.fla" file and go to first frame in the timeline actions:

    slide = "on"; // slide is on by default, set to off if you want the slide stopped in the first load
    timer = 6000; // DEFINE HERE SLIDE TIMER DELAY ( 6 SECONDS IN THIS CASE);



3 - If you need edit fla file, most important symbols are the first ones in the library:
    1 -  PHOTOS(foto)
    3 - GALLERY
    Must important actionscript functions are commented.



AND THATS ALL, I HOPE YOU ENJOY ;)



BEST REGARDS,
Jorge Pires
