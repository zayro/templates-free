Three months later, they each submit three prints that hang in a one-night-only gallery show/party. They then choose a winner without knowing who shot what. Now in its sixth incarnation, NAKED IN THE HOUSE has one a Gemini award and been nominated for another. You can see short segments from each year in the VIDEO section.
