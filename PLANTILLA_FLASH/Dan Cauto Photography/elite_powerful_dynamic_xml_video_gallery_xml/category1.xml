		<desc><![CDATA[Catfight began life as a 'what would happen if...?' in a bar when I was having drinks with Sifu Rupert Harvey and his friend, lawyer Peter Carey. From there, it took on a life of it's own. Shot on location over ten days at a villa in the Turks and Caicos, Catfight is currently in the process of raising the funds to shoot 13x30 episodes.

with model Jenn]]></topic>
		<desc><![CDATA[This was probably the most popular show. Something about the weather and the danger really hit a chord with viewers. And what can I say about Jenn? As beautiful as she was courageous. Massive propane heaters were brought in to try and keep the place warm but it was just too damn big. We managed to seal the make-up room with plastic and keep it warm but this was no walk in the park for the model. And she had to be fresh and perform for 12 photographers. An amazing performance.

with model Kari]]></topic>
		<desc><![CDATA[This was the year I decided to broaden things a bit and shoot outdoors on the property of as well as in the house. The location scout found a stunning home near Barrie on Lake Simcoe. The contest received a very polarized response, some feeling that the purity of the concept had been violated. This was the first year the show hung in a gallery.
