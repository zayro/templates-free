Hi!, thanks for buying, this is the help file


- How to Modify/Use

	To modify the content of the windows, the menu items and some template settings open the "Windows Tmeplate.xml" file
	and read the documentation for each parameter before you make any changes. It's pretty easy to understand and it's well 
	documented.

	IMPORTANT: 
		
		- If you call external SWF it's important that you publish those SWF movies with Flash 8 or higher.

		- When a SWF is loaded into the Windows Template movie all of the relative URLs for the SWF loadad are relative
		  to the Windows Template directory. For example:

			I have a SWF movie called Video1.swf that loads a FLV video called CLOUDS2.flv and both files are located
			in a folder called Videos. The Windows Template is located in the Video's parent folder. Therefore when we load the 
			SWF movie in the Windows Template we have to change the URL for the FLV video we are loading in the SWF movie
			to: "Videos/Video1.flv" even though both files are in the same directory.
		
		- Don't worry about the use of "_root" in the ActionScript of your SWF movies. I've set the "_lockroot" property to true
		  for all the SWF movies loaded into the Windows Template.

		- The Windows Template frame rate is 25fps and all the movies loaded into the template will play at the same frame rate.
		  Consider this before you start working on you SWF files or change the Windows Template frame rate if you must.
